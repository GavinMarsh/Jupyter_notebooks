    "#### Fragmentation\n",
    "Before we begin exploring way to harness crypto data, we need to understand its characteristics. One of its main features is fragmentation. If you have any experience trading cryptocurrencies, you will know that there are dozens of exchanges that handle the lion’s share of traded volume. That means that in order to capture all the data that comes out of these venues, you will have to be listening to updates from each one of them. Fragmentation also means that data is asynchronous, or having non-deterministic arrival rates. Due to almost complete lack of regulation, central limit order book (CLOB) and order routing are alien concepts on the crypto scene."

    "#### Technological Inferiority\n",
    "If you were around in early December 2017, you would have know that virtually each and every sizeable crypto venue had matching engine dysfunction when craze from retail and institutional investors overwhelmed fragile exchanges. That being said, technological issues and maintenance periods are a common occurrence, as simple Google search will yield. That means our data collection engine needs to be resonant with such instabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enter CryptoFeed\n",
    "CryptoFeed is a Python based library built and maintained by Bryant Moscon. The library takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and websockets libraries to provide a unified feed from arbitrary number of supported exchanges. CryptoFeed has a robust re-connection logic in the case exchange APIs temporarily stop sending websocket packets for one reason or another. As a first step, clone the library and run this example: https://github.com/bmoscon/cryptofeed/blob/master/examples/demo.py. It demonstrates how easy it is to combine streams from different exchanges into one feed. \n",

    "\n",
    "That was nice and easy, but you somehow need to persist the data you receive. CryptoFeed provides a nice example of storing data in Man AHL’s open-source Arctic database. Arctic wraps around MongoDB to provide a nice interface for storing Python objects. I even had a pleasure of contributing to Arctic during Man AHL’s 2018 Hackathon which was held back in April!"

    "#### Arctic and Frequently Ticking Data\n",
    "The problem of using Arctic for higher frequency data is that every time you have an update, Arctic has to do a bunch of overhead routines in order to store the Python object (usually a pandas DataFrame) in Mongo. This becomes non-feasible if you do not perform any data batching. When reading the data back, Arctic would need to decompress the objects. In my experience this creates a huge delay in read/write times. There are, however, very nice solutions to this problem and one of them is using Kafka PubSub patterns to accumulate sufficient data before sending it to Arctic, but such patterns are beyond the scope of this article. That being said, we need another storage mechanism to be oblivious to asynchronous writing operations.\n",

    "#### Enter kdb+\n",
    "kdb+ is a columnar, in-memory database that is unparalleled in storage of time-series data, owned and maintained by Kx Systemes. Invented by Authur Whitney, kdb+ is used across financial, telecom, manufacturing industries (and even F1 teams) to store, clean and analyse vast amounts of time-series data. In the realm of electronic trading, kdb+ serves purposes of message processing, data engineering and data storage. kdb+ is powered by programming language q. The technology is largely proprietary, however you may use the free 32-bit version for academic research purposes, which is what we intend to use it for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three packages that you will be able to install: kdb, embedpy and jupyterq. Check out the Kx packages at https://anaconda.org/kx. At present, it is available for Linux and OSX. Windows support will be added in time. It will install the non-commercial personal edition of kdb+ on demand (the kdb package) — which requires an open internet connection. The second package you can install is embedpy https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy, the kdb+/Python library, which forms the base of our machine learning initiative. The final package you can install is jupyterq, the Jupyter kernel for kdb+. The way the dependency tree works, if you install jupyterq https://github.com/KxSystems/jupyterq it will automatically install the embedpy package and the kdb package.\n",
