    "\n",
    "### Create an alias, aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "      alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "      unalias [-a] [name ... ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key\n",
    "   -p   Print the current values\n",
    "\n",
    "   -a   Remove All aliases\n",
    "If arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each name whose value is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no value is given, alias will print the current value of the alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without arguments or with the -p option, alias prints the list of aliases on the standard output in a form that allows them to be reused as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value cannot contain any positional parameters (1 etc) if you need to do that use a shell function instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name can not be 'alias' or 'unalias'.\n",
    "\n",
    "unalias can be used to remove each name from the list of defined aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make an alias permanent\n",
    "Use your favorite text editor to create a file called ~/.bash_aliases, and type the alias commands into the file.\n",
    ".bash_aliases will run at login (or you can just execute it with ..bash_aliases )\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand Multiple aliases\n",
    "If the last character of the alias value is a space or tab character, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details of alias replacement\n",
    "The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The alias name and the replacement text can contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters, with the exception that the alias name can not contain '='.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one can alias ls to \"ls -F\", for instance, and Bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt .\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing. Bash always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that line. Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command. As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "'alias' and 'unalias' are BASH built-ins. For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferred over aliases.\n",

    "## How to Add a Directory to PATH in Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a command on the command line, you’re basically telling the shell to run an executable file with the given name. In Linux these executable programs like ls, find, file and others, usually live inside several different directories on your system. Any file with executable permissions stored in these directories can be run from any location. The most common directories that hold executable programs are /bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does the shell knows, what directories to search for executable programs or does the shell search through the whole filesystem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is simple. When you type a command, the shell searches through all directories specified in the user $PATH variable for an executable file of that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article shows how to add directories to your $PATH in Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is $PATH in Linux\n",
    "The $PATH environmental variable is a colon-delimited list of directories that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To check what directories are in your $PATH, you can use either the printenv or echo command:\n",
    "\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "The output will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin\n",
    "If you have two executable files sharing the same name located in two different directories the shell will run the file that lives in the directory which comes first in the $PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a Directory to your $PATH\n",
    "There are situations where you may want to add other directories the $PATH variable. For example, some programs may be installed in different locations or you may want to have a dedicated directory for your personal scrips, but be able to run them without specifying the absolute path to the executable files. To do this you simply need to add the directory to your $PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a directory called bin located in your Home directory in which you keep your shell scripts. To add the directory to your $PATH type in:\n",
    "\n",
    "export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "The export command will export the modified variable to the shell child process environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now run your scripts simply by typing the executable script name without needing to specify the executable full path.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this change is only temporary and valid only in the current shell session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the change permanent, you need to define the $PATH variable in the shell configuration files. In most Linux distributions when you start a new session, environment variables are read from the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "Global shell specific configuration files such as /etc/environment and /etc/profile. Use this file if you want the new directory to be added to all system users $PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per-user shell specific configuration files. For example, if you are using Bash, you can set the $PATH variable in the ~/.bashrc file and if you are using Zsh the file name is ~/.zshrc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’ll set the variable in the ~/.bashrc file. Open the file with your text editor and add the following line at the end of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "~/.bashrc\n",
    "export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Save the file and load the new $PATH into the current shell session using the source command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that the directory was successfully added, print the value of your $PATH by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Adding new directories to your user or global $PATH variable is pretty simple. This allows you execute commands and scripts stored on nonstandard locations without needing to type the full path to the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same instructions apply for any Linux distribution, including Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Debian and Linux Mint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.\n"
