    "\n",
    "https://websiteforstudents.com/how-to-install-influxdb-on-ubuntu-18-04-16-04/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to install InfluxDB on Ubuntu. However, the easiest and fastest way is to install it from its official repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, run the commands below to add its repository key to Ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -`\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the key, run the commands below to create a repository file\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo echo \"deb https://repos.influxdata.com/ubuntu bionic stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re done adding the repository key and file, run the commands below to update Ubuntu packages index and install InfluxDB\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt update`\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt install influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing, the commands below can be used to stop, start and enable InfluxDB services to automatically start up when the server boots.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl stop influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl start influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl enable --now influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl is-enabled influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "To check and validate that InfluxDB is installed and running, run the status command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl status influxdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "That should display similar lines as shown below:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 2: Configure InfluxDB\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, InfluxDB configuration file is at under `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of its configurations are commented out and not used. Go and make changes to the configuration file that suit your environment. When you’re done, save the file and exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to allow HTTP authentication, enable the line under `[http]` as shown in the file below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo nano /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit the line shown and save.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[http]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "`enabled = true`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determines whether the Flux query endpoint is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "`flux-enabled = false`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restart InfluxDB after making changes to its configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now create an admin account using the commands below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`curl -XPOST \"http://localhost:8086/query\" --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE USER superadmin WITH PASSWORD 'type_password_here' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### create an admin\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `superadmin` and `ype_password_here` with username and password for the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log-in to Influx terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve created an admin account, you can access InfluxDB terminal console by running the commands below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`influx -username 'superadmin' -password 'your_password_here'`\n",
    "\n",
    "That should logon to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.10\n",
    "InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.10\n",
    "By default, it communicates on port 8086.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use curl to run queries. For example, to list databases, run the curl commands below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`curl -G http://localhost:8086/query -u superadmin:password_here --data-urlencode \"q=SHOW DATABASES\"`"
